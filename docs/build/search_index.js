The new shape will result in the combination of the scaled and rotated templates at each segment. This process can be repeated multiple times to get a fractal where each segment of the new shape will be modified following the template. To scale we calculate the length of the segment and the line_length of the template and scale the template depending on this value. The translation of the template is done so that the first point of the template coincides with the first point of the segment.\n\nWhen using the noise_params each segment will have a unique noise signal i.e. each segment will have a unique template. \n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"functions/#Fractalizer.random_template","page":"Functions","title":"Fractalizer.random_template","text":"random_template(params::NoiseParams)\n\nGenerate a random template given the parameters in NoiseParams\n\nInput\n\nparams – NoiseParams struct with all the settings for random generation \n\nOutput\n\nA Template object\n\nAlgorithm\n\nThe random template is defined as follows:\n\nA random value of amplitude, frequency and phase are picked from the ranges\nA sine wave in (0,2π) is generated with the picked resolution and the random values\nA random selection of nsamples are then picked from the signal \n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"functions/#Fractalizer.makering","page":"Functions","title":"Fractalizer.makering","text":"makering(x0, y0, r, npoints)\n\nCreate a ring.\n\nInput\n\nx0 – x center of the ring\ny0 – y center of the ring\nr – radius of the ring\nnpoints – n of points of the ring\n\nOutput\n\nA ClosedShape object\n\nNotes\n\nSince the output is a closed shape, the number of sides is 1-npoints.
