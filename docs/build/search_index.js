The new shape will result in the combination of the scaled and rotated templates at each segment. This process can be repeated multiple times to get a fractal where each segment of the new shape will be modified following the template. To scale we calculate the length of the segment and the line_length of the template and scale the template depending on this value. The translation of the template is done so that the first point of the template coincides with the first point of the segment.\n\nWhen using the noise_params each segment will have a unique noise signal i.e. each segment will have a unique template. \n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#Fractalizer.Shape","page":"Fractalizer.jl documentation","title":"Fractalizer.Shape","text":"Shape <: AbstractShape\n\nType to encapsulate shapes that need to be fractalized.\n\nFields\n\ncentroid – [x, y] vector of the coordinates of the centroid of the shape\nnpoints – Number of points of the shape\nnsegments – Number of segments of the shape\nsegment_lengths – Lengths of each segment of the shape \nsegment_angles – Azimuthal angle (0,360) of each segment in the shape, with [1,0] as reference 0°.\nsegment_centers – Center of each segment of the shape.  \nsegment_normals – Normals of each segment of the shape.  \npoints – nx2 Matrix of points\nedges – nx2 connectivity Matrix indicating the indexes of the points that define the segment\nbb – 4x2 Matrix indicating the bounding box of the shape.
